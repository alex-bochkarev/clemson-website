In bioinformatics, there is a special type of graph that is sometimes used to compare two sequences, that is called a [dot-plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_plot_(bioinformatics)). I have written a tiny R script to randomly generate such graphs / event sequences (in fact, a simple wrapper around `ggplot2` and co.). Please see [github](https://github.com/alex-bochkarev/dotplot-gen) for details.
