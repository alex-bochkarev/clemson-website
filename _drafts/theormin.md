While I was getting ready for my IE qualifying exams here at Clemson University, I realized that I needed a big-picture of some basic concepts to pack them into my head. So, I took some of my favorite pieces of free software, and produced a couple of mind-maps (aka ``spiders'' that loosely cover the first-year standard coursework. The intention was to make something like a ``theoretical minimum'' outline, a structured list of topics that would allow a PhD student to start thinking about the research. I deliberately tried to be more informal (as there are already a lot of rigorous notes on that -- the topics are basic), but do not omit important details. It turned out to be far from perfect -- but I'd really appreciate any feedback and notes on use-cases.

**A technical note:** To me, the hands-down most convenient way of viewing this is with [Freeplane](https://www.freeplane.org/wiki/index.php/Home). The software is free and seems even not to require installation. Just download and you are (more or less) good to go. It allows you to un/fold the nodes you are interested in and keep a conveniently scaled picture on your monitor. Other than that, PDF seems to be the second best, although you might need some [proprietary software](https://get.adobe.com/reader/otherversions/) to read it properly. For example,
I know it renders and, most importantly, zooms very well on an iPad (but, obviously, does not allow for node folding). If it does not work for you for some reason, PNG and JPG formats are fine, overall, but have some problems with inline pictures in the deterministic part.

# What is this?
I just love [mindmaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map)[^1]. Since they have a tree structure, I find them especially useful for:
- structuring the information (to me, it helps a lot to ``process'' it);
- going through to check if I understand and remember everything (it feels way more efficient than just going through lecture notes);
- checking some details later, if I need to.

So I prepared two mind-maps (corresponding to the structure of the coursework we had) -- for the stochastic and the deterministic part.
