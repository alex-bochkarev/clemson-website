The textbook by [Bazaraa et al](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Nonlinear+Programming%3A+Theory+and+Algorithms%2C+3rd+Edition-p-9780471486008) provided a summary diagram describing connections between different classes of functions (generalizing the concept convexity) in terms of "implications" (like "strict convexity ‚ü∂ convexity") as well as detailed notes with examples. However, I wanted to have a one-pager with the key information for quick reference - definitions + short notes on intuition; preferably, with relations being depicted as an [Euler diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_diagram). So, I tried to compile everything together on one US Letter page.
